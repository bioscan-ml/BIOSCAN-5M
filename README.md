#### Cropped images
We trained a model on examples from this dataset in order to create a tool introduced in [BIOSCAN-1M](https://github.com/zahrag/BIOSCAN-1M), which can automatically generate bounding boxes around the insect.
We used this to crop each image down to only the region of interest.

Benchmark Experiments
---------------------

### Data Partitions
We partitioned the BIOSCAN-5M dataset into splits for both closed-world and open-world machine learning problems. 
To use the partitions we propose, see the <code>split</code> field of the metadata file(s).


* The **closed-world** classification task uses samples labelled with a scientific name for their species
(<code>train</code>, <code>val</code>, and <code>test</code> partitions).
  * This task requires the model to correctly classify new images and DNA barcodes of across a known set of species labels that were seen during training.

* The **open-world** classification task uses samples whose species name is a placeholder name,
and whose genus name is a scientific name
(<code>key_unseen</code>, <code>val_unseen</code>, and <code>test_unseen</code> partitions).
  * This task requires the model to correctly group together new species that were not seen during training.
  * In the retreival paradigm, this task can be performed using <code>test_unseen</code> records as queries against keys from the <code>key_unseen</code> records.
  * Alternatively, this data can be evaluated at the genus-level by classification via the species in the <code>train</code> partition.

* Samples labelled with placeholder species names, and whose genus name is not a scientific name are placed in the <code>other_heldout</code> partition.
  * This data can be used to train an unseen species novelty detector.

* Samples without species labels are placed in the <code>pretrain</code> partition, which comprises 90% of the data.
  * This data can be used for self-supervised or semi-supervised training.

### Task-I: DNA-based taxonomic classification task
Two stages of the proposed semi-supervised learning set-up based on [BarcodeBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02401). 
1. Pretraining: DNA sequences are tokenized using non-overlapping k-mers and 50% of the tokens are masked for the MLM task. 
Tokens are encoded and fed into a transformer model. The output embeddings are used for token-level classification. 
2. Fine-tuning: All DNA sequences in a dataset are tokenized using non-overlapping $k$-mer tokenization and all tokenized sequences, without masking, are passed through the pretrained transformer model.  Global mean-pooling is applied over the token-level embeddings and the output is used for taxonomic classification.

#### Results
The performance of the taxonomic classification using DNA barcode sequences of the BIOSCAN-5M dataset is summarized as follows:

**Performance of DNA-based sequence models** in closed- and open-world settings.  
For the closed-world setting, we show the species-level accuracy (%) for predicting seen species.  
For the open-world setting, we show genus-level accuracy (%) for unseen species, while using seen species to fit the model.

### Task-II: Zero-shot transfer learning task
We follow the experimental setup recommended by [zero-shot clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02465),
expanded to operate on multiple modalities.
1. Take pretrained encoders.
2. Extract feature vectors from the stimuli by passing them through the pretrained encoder.
3. Reduce the embeddings with UMAP.
4. Cluster the reduced embeddings with Agglomerative Clustering.
5. Evaluate against the ground-truth annotations with Adjusted Mutual Information.

### Task-III: Multimodal retrieval learning task
Our experiments using the [BIOSCAN-CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17537) are conducted in two steps. 
1. Training: Multiple modalities, including RGB images, textual taxonomy, and DNA sequences, are encoded separately, 
and trained using a contrastive loss function. 
2. Inference: Image vs DNA embedding is used as a query, and compared to the embeddings obtained from a database of image, 
DNA and text (keys). The cosine similarity is used to find the closest key embedding, and the corresponding taxonomic label is used to classify the query.
